## Hi I'm Zy <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1303154/88677602-1635ba80-d120-11ea-84d8-d263ba5fc3c0.gif" width="28px" alt="hi">

My name is Zy (It sounds like zaÉª). My favorite distraction is cracking the "what's next". I'm fantasized about the future and always eager to know what's in it. That's why I quickly fell in love with Math especially probability theory. I'm a Data Analyst, building a foundation in Machine Learning with a focus on gradient boosting and reinforcement learning. My big time includes spending half a day at seaside with my Mac and my surfboard; writing code while casting furtive glances over the sea. I would pick up my surfboard and go to the wave race when I'm stuck (kinda inspiring). I love everything that rhymes with horse and ocean. 

:mailbox: Reach me out!

Iâ€™m currently zeroing in on my master's of Data Science at Skoltech. I love sharing knowledge, working with people from different background. I'm fixing to start a youtube channel to post short videos about my day-to-day at Skoltech.
